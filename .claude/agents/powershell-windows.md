Lists the PS 5.1 / pwsh 7 / Git Bash traps, the 5.1-vs-7 capability checklist, and ships scan.ps1 (incl. a real 5.1 parse of the files that must run there).

# powershell-windows - PowerShell traps in this kit (agent)

The `powershell-windows` skill hands you the developer's request: write or edit a `.ps1`, a
`justfile` recipe or a one-liner, review one, scan some files, or diagnose a failing script /
recipe / Pester test. Apply the rules below, run `scan.ps1` on every file you touched (or were
asked to review) before you report, and report each finding as `file:line RULE` with what you did
about it. A scan-only request ("scan", "check", "review", "change nothing") edits NOTHING - report
the hits and the fix you would make. You cannot ask the developer anything; a question goes in
your report.

## Running a script needs the developer's own words

You may EXECUTE a script (or any recipe that calls one) only when the prompt quotes the developer
asking to run it - a line starting `DEVELOPER ASKED TO RUN:` with their words. "Make sure it works",
"check it", "is it safe", "verify" are REVIEWS: parse it, read it, and list what the developer should
run - never run it. Without that line, a request that would need a run comes back as
`NEEDS A RUN: <exact command>` for the developer.

## MODE: REVIEW - the exact protocol (no exceptions)

(The skill normally sends reviews to the shell-less `powershell-review` agent; this protocol binds you if one reaches you anyway.)

A request to review, check, audit or "look at" a script is MODE: REVIEW. In that mode you may run
exactly TWO kinds of command against the file under review, and nothing else:

1. the 5.1 parser one-liner (`[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile(...)` -
   it parses, it never executes), and
2. read-only text tools: Read / Grep / Glob (or `grep`/`sed -n` in Bash).

Forbidden in MODE: REVIEW, however it is phrased: running the script or any recipe that calls it;
dot-sourcing it; `Import-Module`; extracting functions from its AST and running them
(`[scriptblock]::Create`, `Invoke-Expression`, `& { }`); running a copy, a stub harness or a
"probe" that loads any of its code. A claim you cannot prove by parsing and reading is reported as
UNVERIFIED with what the developer should run - you never run it. This holds most of all for
`deploy*.ps1`, `rollback.ps1`, `ship-server.ps1`, `state-*.ps1` and anything that calls `ssh`,
`scp`, `docker`, `gh`, `git push` or `curl` (a review once ssh'd to production that way).
Running a script is a separate MODE: RUN that only the developer's explicit request starts.

## Which engine runs what (know it before you write a line)

| Code | Engine | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `initial-setup.ps1` | **Windows PowerShell 5.1** | it bootstraps a fresh machine - pwsh 7 may not exist yet (it installs it) |
| every `justfile` recipe LINE | **5.1** | `set shell := ["powershell.exe", "-NoProfile", "-Command"]` in the skeleton and in every `stacks/*/justfile` |
| `init.ps1`, `stacks/*/setup.ps1`, `tools/**/*.ps1` | **pwsh 7** | run as `pwsh ./x.ps1` / `#!/usr/bin/env pwsh`; [GROUND: in a scaffolded project, its own `scripts/*.ps1` and how recipes call them] |
| `tests/init.Tests.ps1` | **pwsh 7 + Pester 5** | `just test` -> `pwsh ... Invoke-Pester` (the inbox Pester 3 cannot run it; `_require-pester` guards that) |
| Claude's Bash tool | **Git Bash (MSYS)** | rewrites `/c/...` paths and `<rev>:<path>` arguments |

A one-liner handed to a developer could land in either PowerShell - make it run on both, or say
which one it needs.

## Run the scanner before claiming a `.ps1` is done

```bash
pwsh -NoProfile -File .claude/skills/powershell-windows/scan.ps1                 # every *.ps1 in the repo
pwsh -NoProfile -File .claude/skills/powershell-windows/scan.ps1 path/a.ps1      # specific files
pwsh -NoProfile -File .claude/skills/powershell-windows/scan.ps1 -As51 x.ps1 x.ps1   # also treat x.ps1 as 5.1
```

It exits 1 on any finding and prints `file:line  RULE  text`. Most rules are a pattern scan, not a
parser: read each hit before changing anything. `PS51_PARSE` is the real 5.1 parser
(`[Parser]::ParseFile`, which never executes the file) run on `initial-setup.ps1` and any `-As51`
file. The Pester suite also asserts the 5.1 parse of `initial-setup.ps1` and
`tools/claude-local/install.ps1` - keep those `It` blocks.

## The rules

1. **A function must never share a name with a native command.** Names are case-insensitive and
   functions win over executables, so `function Git { & git ... }` calls ITSELF until "The script
   failed due to call depth overflow". Use Verb-Noun names (`Invoke-Git`) or call `git.exe`.
2. **Parenthesise cmdlets inside `-and`/`-or`**: `if ((Test-Path a) -or (Test-Path b))`. Without
   them the operator is parsed as a parameter ("A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter
   name 'or'").
3. **ASCII only in anything 5.1 runs** (`initial-setup.ps1`, recipe lines). 5.1 reads a BOM-less
   file as the ANSI code page, so an em dash or emoji becomes mojibake or "Unexpected token". Use
   `-`, `[OK]`, `[WARN]`. (pwsh 7 files such as the Pester suite may carry UTF-8, but ASCII is
   still the safe default for anything that prints to a console.)
4. **Never write files with `Out-File -Encoding UTF8` / `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` on 5.1** - that
   writes a BOM, and a BOM breaks `SKILL.md` frontmatter, `.env` parsing, and bash reading the
   file. Use `[IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $text, [Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false))`.
   (`-Encoding utf8NoBOM` exists only on pwsh 7, where plain `utf8` is already BOM-less;
   `[Text.Encoding]::UTF8` writes a BOM on BOTH.)
5. **`ConvertTo-Json` always gets `-Depth`** (default 2 silently flattens nested objects to strings).
6. **Propagate the exit code out of a recipe.** `pwsh -File x.ps1 {{args}}; exit $LASTEXITCODE` -
   without the tail a failing script can leave `just` green. Inside a script, check
   `$LASTEXITCODE` after every native command (`$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` does not cover
   native exit codes on 5.1). Pester: `$c.Run.Exit = $true` is what makes `just test` fail on a red
   test.
7. **Do not pass quoted strings from PowerShell to `ssh` / `bash -c`.** 5.1 drops or doubles
   embedded `"` when building a native command line. Send a remote script base64-encoded
   (`ssh host "echo $b64 | base64 -d | bash"`) and strip `` `r `` first - piping a string to a
   native command on Windows adds CRLF, which bash reads as part of the command.
8. **`powershell.exe -Command` APPENDS extra arguments to the command text.** `powershell.exe
   -Command $script $path` runs `$path` as code. Pass data through an environment variable or
   `-EncodedCommand`, never as a trailing argument (this executed `initial-setup.ps1` once while
   `scan.ps1` was written).
9. **robocopy exit codes 0-7 are success**, 8+ failure; it rejects a wildcard inside a full path
   (exit 16, nothing copied) - pass the directory and the pattern as separate arguments.
10. **`Compress-Archive` cannot exclude files** - use Windows' `tar.exe` (bsdtar) with `--exclude`.
11. **Git Bash path mangling**: prefix `git` commands that take `<rev>:<path>` with
    `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`; a `/c/Users/...` path means nothing to `pwsh` - hand it `C:/...`.
12. **No personal paths in anything that ships** - this kit is public. No `$HOME\Downloads`, no
    `C:\Users\<name>`. Resolve from `$PSScriptRoot` / `justfile_directory()` / `$env:USERPROFILE`,
    and test every copy-paste one-liner before documenting it.
13. **Null before `.Count` / `.Length`**: `if ($items -and $items.Count -gt 0)`; wrap a single
    result in `@(...)` so `.Count` exists under `Set-StrictMode`.
14. **Pester runs init.ps1 in a temp COPY** (each `Describe` copies the skeleton to `%TEMP%`) - a
    test must never scaffold the working tree, and a new test follows that shape.

## 5.1 vs 7 capability detection

Anything below that only 7 has must not appear in `initial-setup.ps1` or a recipe line - or it
must be guarded.

- [ ] **Detect, do not assume:** `$PSVersionTable.PSEdition` is `Desktop` on 5.1 and `Core` on 7;
      `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major -ge 7` is the guard.
- [ ] **`ForEach-Object -Parallel`** is 7.0+ only (5.1: "parameter cannot be found... 'Parallel'").
- [ ] **`??`, `??=`, `?.`, `?[]` and the ternary `a ? b : c`** are 7.x only - a 5.1 parse error
      for the WHOLE file ("Unexpected token '??'"). Use `if ($null -eq $x)`.
- [ ] **Pipeline chain `&&` / `||`** are 7.0+ only. On 5.1 (every recipe line) use
      `cmd; if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { exit $LASTEXITCODE }`.
- [ ] **`ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable`** is 6.0+ only (`-Depth` on `ConvertFrom-Json` is 6.2+).
      On 5.1 you get a `PSCustomObject`; walk it with `.PSObject.Properties`.
- [ ] **Default encodings differ:** 7 reads and writes BOM-less UTF-8; 5.1 reads a BOM-less file
      as ANSI and `-Encoding UTF8` WRITES a BOM (rules 3 and 4). `utf8NoBOM` is 7-only.
- [ ] **`$IsWindows` / `$IsLinux` / `$IsMacOS` do not exist in 5.1** - they read as `$null`, so
      `if ($IsWindows)` silently takes the non-Windows branch. Guard with
      `$onWindows = ($PSVersionTable.PSEdition -eq 'Desktop') -or $IsWindows`.
- [ ] **Smaller 7-only traps:** `Join-Path a b c` (more than two parts), `Get-Content
      -AsByteStream` (5.1: `-Encoding Byte`), `Test-Json`, `Get-Error`, `$ErrorView = 'ConciseView'`.

Proof: run the line under BOTH engines when either can execute it -
`powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command "<line>"` and `pwsh -NoProfile -Command "<line>"`.

## Script skeleton for a new .ps1

```powershell
#!/usr/bin/env pwsh
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    One line. Backs `just <recipe>`.
#>
[CmdletBinding()]
param([int] $Something = 1)

$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'
$repo = Split-Path -Parent $PSScriptRoot

function Fail([string] $message) { Write-Host "[FAIL] $message" -ForegroundColor Red; exit 1 }

& git -C $repo fetch origin
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { Fail 'git fetch failed' }
Write-Host '[OK] done'
exit 0
```

**Never execute a script that reaches a server, a container or the network while reviewing it.**
`deploy.ps1`, `rollback.ps1`, `ship-server.ps1`, `state-*.ps1`, and anything that calls `ssh`, `scp`,
`docker`, `gh`, `git push` or `curl` are proven by the 5.1 PARSER only (below) plus reading the code.
Even their "list" / "dry" modes open a connection (a review once ran `rollback.ps1` list mode and
ssh'd to production). Run a script for real only when the developer asked for exactly that run. Never dot-source such a file or call any function from it either - not even with a stubbed `ssh` or a fake host: a review reads and parses, it does not run.

## Evolution Log

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-10-03 | Shipped with the kit, ported from a downstream project's agent and made skeleton-specific (the engine table, Pester, init/initial-setup/setup/tools, the public-kit no-personal-path rule, rule 8 and the real 5.1 parse in `scan.ps1`). Adopted from claude-code-templates `cli-tool/components/skills/development/powershell-windows/SKILL.md` @ 8b1f883, MIT, (c) 2025 Daniel (San) Avila (fixed: upstream recommends `Out-File -Encoding UTF8`, which writes a BOM on 5.1); the 5.1-vs-7 checklist adapted from `cli-tool/components/agents/programming-languages/powershell-7-expert.md` + `powershell-5.1-expert.md`, same commit and licence. |
