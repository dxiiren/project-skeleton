# llm-transfer - Master Prompt Handoff to an External LLM

Package the current work into **one self-contained master prompt** that a fresh external
model - **ChatGPT, Ollama (local), Gemini, DeepSeek, any LLM** - can act on with **zero prior
context**: no access to this repo, this session, or any tool. This skill IS the framework: run
it and it assembles the handoff for you.

Whatever the target, the reader is a **cold, tool-less model receiving a pasted or piped
prompt** - even Ollama, whose plain `ollama run` terminal session has no repo/file access
unless you wire up tools yourself. So the job is always the same: embed everything the model
needs.

## Your part of the handoff

The `llm-transfer` skill runs in the main session and has already done the two things only it can
do: settled the **scope, target tool and mode** (asking the developer once if they were unclear),
and written a **session-state summary** (objective and why, done / tried / failed with exact
errors, where it stands, open questions, files touched). You **cannot see that conversation** -
treat the prompt as everything you know about it, and never invent session history. If scope,
tool or mode is missing from the prompt, state the reading you chose in your first line and go on.

Perform these steps **in order**:

1. **Gather context.** Pull **only what's relevant**: the objective and _why_, the current
   state (done / tried / failed / where it stands), the exact code / config / logs / errors /
   data - **read the real files** so artifacts are verbatim - the constraints/stack/
   conventions, and the open questions. The session-state summary from the prompt is the
   source for "Current State"; the repo is the source for artifacts and constraints
   (`git log --oneline -10`, `git status --short`, the files the summary names).

2. **No redaction - verbatim.** The saved file is **git-ignored** and stays on this machine,
   so secrets/tokens are kept **as-is**. External exposure happens only when the developer sends
   the prompt, which they drive:
   - **Local Ollama** - nothing leaves the machine; fully safe.
   - **ChatGPT / Gemini / Ollama Cloud (Turbo)** - the content goes to a third-party service
     when they paste/send it. If a specific _live_ credential worries them, they strip that one
     line by hand first. You won't.

3. **Assemble** the master prompt (cold target) or the orchestration brief (agentic target)
   using **the framework** below.

4. **Save** it to `.claude/workspace/reports/transfers/{tool}/` as `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{topic}.md`
   (`{tool}` = gpt / ollama / gemini / codex; `{topic}` names the work, **not** this skill).
   Create the folder if missing. If the prompt says **print only / do not write**, skip the save
   and say so in the `Saved:` line.

5. **Return** exactly the "Delivery format" below: the full prompt as ONE fenced `text` block,
   then the `Saved:` and `Feed it:` lines (see Per-target notes). Nothing else - the main session
   relays it verbatim. If the main session later sends a correction, rewrite the same file and
   return the whole block again.

## THE FRAMEWORK - master prompt template

Fill every section. Omit a section only when it truly doesn't apply, and say so rather than
leaving it blank. Keep the headings - the structure is what makes the handoff legible to a
cold model. Restate the task at the very end: for a long prompt, the key instruction should
appear at BOTH the top and the bottom (see Design basis).

````text
# MASTER PROMPT - {one-line title of the task}

## 1. Role
You are {persona. [GROUND: 2-3 personas that fit this repo's stack, e.g. "a senior <stack>
engineer" / "a <domain> reviewer" / "a technical copy editor"]}. {Any relevant seniority,
domain, or mindset.}

## 2. Mission
{The single objective, in 1-2 sentences. What "success" delivers.}

## 3. Background & Context
{Everything a model with ZERO prior knowledge and NO repo access needs to understand the
situation: what the project is ([GROUND: one-line description of this app + its shape, e.g.
"a <stack> app doing <what>, <build/serve model>"]), the domain, and WHY this task matters.
Self-contained - assume the reader has never seen this codebase.}

## 4. Current State
- What is already done: ...
- What has been tried: ...
- What failed and how: {exact symptom / error}
- Where it stands right now: ...

## 5. Relevant Artifacts
{Inline the actual code / config / logs / errors / data. Each block labeled with its source
path, separated from your instructions by a fence. Verbatim. Only what's relevant - not a repo
dump.}

`[GROUND: a representative source path from this repo]` (excerpt)
```
{exact contents or the relevant excerpt}
```

{error / log output, if any}
```
{exact text}
```

## 6. Constraints & Rules
- Tech stack: {[GROUND: this repo's stack facts - language, framework, build/serve model,
  how it runs locally]}
- Standards / conventions to honor: ... (cold target: inline the repo's CLAUDE.md rules here;
  an agentic target reads CLAUDE.md itself)
- Hard do's and don'ts: ...
- Anything off-limits: ...

## 7. Your Task
{The precise, unambiguous ask. Exactly what to produce, decide, or solve. If it's a second
opinion, state the problem neutrally - do NOT lead toward a conclusion.}

## 8. Output Format & Success Criteria
- Deliver the answer as: {format - a corrected file, a diff, a step list, a decision + rationale}
- Definition of done: {how we'll know the answer is correct/complete}

## 9. Open Questions & Assumptions
- Known gaps: ...
- If blocked, either ask or state your assumption and proceed: ...

## Reminder (restate - instructions repeated at the end for long context)
{One-line restatement of Section 7: the single thing to deliver.}
````

## Assembly rules (the craft)

- **Self-contained.** The model has no access to this repo, this session, or any tool. If it
  isn't in the prompt, it doesn't exist. Embed it.
- **Selective, not a dump.** Include only artifacts that bear on the task; summarize the rest.
  Respect context limits - three relevant excerpts beat thirty (and see the Ollama note: local
  windows can be small).
- **Fidelity over paraphrase.** Paste exact code, exact errors, exact paths.
- **Instructions top and bottom.** For a long prompt, put the key task at both the start and
  the end; if only once, put it above the pasted context, not below.
- **Local & git-ignored.** The saved copy stays on this machine and is never committed, so
  secrets are left verbatim. Only sending to a cloud service leaves the machine - that call is
  yours.
- **Neutral framing for second opinions.** State the problem and the evidence; don't smuggle
  in the conclusion you already reached.
- **Portable.** The handoff may target any project and any model - spell things out.

## Per-target notes

- **ChatGPT / Gemini (cloud):** large context windows - you rarely hit a limit. Content leaves
  the machine when you paste it. Delivery: paste the block (or the saved `.md`) into the web UI.
- **Ollama (local terminal):** a cold model with no repo/file access in a plain `ollama run`
  session (tool-calling exists but only if you wire tools up yourself). Two real differences
  from ChatGPT:
  - **Small default context.** Ollama's default is VRAM-dependent - **4k tokens under 24 GiB
    VRAM** (32k at 24-48 GiB, 256k at 48 GiB+), and Ollama recommends **>= 64,000 tokens for
    coding/agent work**. A big master prompt can exceed the default, so keep it tight AND raise
    the window: `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=64000 ollama serve` (or per-request `num_ctx`).
  - **Delivery = pipe, not paste.** `cat {file}.md | ollama run {model}` (stdin pipe and
    prompt-as-argument are the documented input forms). Nothing leaves the machine.
  - **Cloud caveat.** Ollama Cloud / Turbo offloads to Ollama's servers (opt-in, sign-in
    required) - when used, treat it like ChatGPT.

## Two target modes: agentic vs cold

The output depends on whether the target can read the repo and run commands.

### Agentic target - Codex / opencode / Aider (or Ollama running inside one)

It HAS the repo, reads files, and runs commands. Do **not** dump a payload - emit a lean
**orchestration brief** that drives the agent to use our own conventions and skills. Include:

1. **Conventions:** "Follow the repo's `CLAUDE.md`." (Codex/opencode/Aider read `AGENTS.md` /
   the repo's instructions automatically; the line reinforces which file to honor.)
2. **Situation (continuation state):** use `claude-transfer`'s brief template - mission,
   DONE / IN PROGRESS / NEXT, pointers (`path:line`, recent commits), open questions,
   dead-ends, first action. Pointer-based; the agent re-reads files itself. This is the
   "continue where Claude left off" payload.
3. **Use our skills:** name the relevant playbook(s) and tell it to follow them - _"For this
   task, read and follow `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` (and the skills it references); run
   its scripts, e.g. `uv run --no-project python .claude/skills/<skill>/<x>.py`."_ Our skills
   are just markdown playbooks + stdlib Python - an agent can read and run them. **This is how
   the agent "uses our skills."**
4. **MCP caveat:** skills that use the GitHub MCP need it configured in the agent (Codex
   supports MCP). Until then, do those steps by hand.
5. **First action:** the single next step.

Save to `transfers/{tool}/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{topic}.md`; hand the file over (paste it, or tell the
agent "read `<path>` and proceed").

### Cold target - browser ChatGPT / plain `ollama run`

No repo, no tools. It **cannot** read `CLAUDE.md` or our skills. Use the full self-contained
master-prompt framework above; if it must follow project rules or a skill's method, **inline**
the relevant `CLAUDE.md` rules / SKILL.md steps into the prompt (Section 6).

## Delivery format

Chat:

````text
```text
# MASTER PROMPT - ...
...full assembled prompt...
```
````

Then:

```text
Saved: .claude/workspace/reports/transfers/{tool}/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{topic}.md
Feed it:  (gpt/gemini) paste into the web UI   |   (ollama) cat <file> | ollama run <model>
```

## Worked example (compact)

[GROUND: replace this marker with one compact worked example for THIS repo - a realistic
small handoff (a bug or a focused change in this codebase) showing all 9 sections filled,
with a real excerpt from this repo in Section 5 and this repo's stack facts in Section 6.
Keep it under ~50 lines; end with the one-line Reminder.]

That's the shape of every handoff - scale each section up or down to fit the task.

## Design basis (researched 2026-07-01)

- **Instructions top and bottom** of a long prompt - [OpenAI GPT-4.1 prompting guide](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide). (The template's closing Reminder exists for this.)
- **Ollama specifics - verified directly from official docs:** default context is small and
  VRAM-dependent (4k / 32k / 256k), 64k recommended for coding
  ([context length](https://docs.ollama.com/context-length)); a plain `ollama run` has no
  tool/repo access unless the caller wires tools
  ([tool calling](https://docs.ollama.com/capabilities/tool-calling)); local by default,
  Cloud/Turbo is opt-in and sends data off-machine ([cloud](https://docs.ollama.com/cloud));
  stdin-pipe / argument input ([cli](https://docs.ollama.com/cli)).
- **Unverified / honest gaps:** the 9-section scaffold and ordering are standard practice but
  could not be independently confirmed - treat as judgment, not fact. The verbatim-local stance
  is a deliberate call; [OWASP LLM02](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm022025-sensitive-information-disclosure/)
  flags the sensitive-info-disclosure risk class.

## Evolution Log

- Shipped with the project-skeleton kit: same 9-section framework and dual-mode design proven
  across the stamped dxiiren repos. `/ground-project` resolves the `[GROUND: ...]` personas,
  stack lines, and the worked example against this repo.
- 2026-10-03 — converted to a subagent. The assembly (gather, assemble, save, return) moved
  here from `SKILL.md`; the developer-facing steps (pick scope/tool/mode, ask once if unclear,
  write the session state only the main session knows, review the result) stay in the skill.
  The old `EnterPlanMode` step is replaced by an explicit review gate in the skill: a subagent
  cannot enter plan mode, and plan mode would block the save.
