# Skills Catalog — `@@REPO_SLUG@@`

Project development skills for @@PROJECT_TITLE@@. Each lives in its own directory with a
`SKILL.md`. **Follow the relevant skill before writing code.** Run `/audit-skills` to verify
every skill here is registered and that `CLAUDE.md` references only existing skills.

Model tiers: `sonnet` (floor) · `opus` (deep reasoning / generation).

**Every skill hands its procedure to an agent.** Each `SKILL.md` is a thin shim whose first action is 
`Agent(subagent_type: "<name>", model: "opus")`; the procedure lives in `.claude/agents/<name>.md` (`model: opus`). 
Interactive steps (owner approval, AskUserQuestion) stay in the shim; `verify-before-claim` maps to `verifier`. 
An optional skill keeps its agent beside it (`skills-optional/<name>/agent.md`) until `/ground-project` enables it. 
A skill a production app loads byte-for-byte is runtime-locked (never shimmed; list it in `audit.py` `RUNTIME_LOCKED`). 
`/audit-skills` FAILS (NO_AGENT) on a skill without its agent. `.claude/agents/` must never ship in an image. 

Re-sweeping aitmpl for new things to adopt: see [`AITMPL-RESWEEP.md`](../../AITMPL-RESWEEP.md).

## Scaffolding

| Skill                                       | What it does                                                                                                                                       | Model |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| [ground-project](ground-project/SKILL.md)   | One-time grounding pass after `init.ps1`: fills content tokens, grounds skills in the real code, enables optional skills, audits, and boot-verifies. | opus  |

| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| [commit](commit/SKILL.md)       | Conventional-Commits stage + message flow (stale-lock preflight, `git add -A` fast path, scoped stage-by-name). Never auto-commits, never amends, no attribution footer. | sonnet |
| [create-pr](create-pr/SKILL.md) | Push the current branch and open a **GitHub** PR into `main` via `gh` / GitHub MCP, with a clean Summary/Changes/Testing body and no attribution footer.                 | opus   |

## Quality & Review

| Skill                                               | What it does                                                                                                                    | Model  |

| [audit-docs](audit-docs/SKILL.md)                   | Layered adversarial audit of a document set (cross-set → re-verify → per-document), with the fix loop and an `audits/` trail.   | opus   |
| [systematic-debugging](systematic-debugging/SKILL.md) | Root cause before any fix: live state first, one hypothesis, test-first fix, stop after three failed fixes; ships `find-polluter.sh`. | opus   |
| [test-driven-development](test-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Red seen, then green, never commit red; infra acceptance tables and source-level guard tests proven with a mutant. | opus   |

## Optional skills (in `.claude/skills-optional/` — not active)

`/ground-project` moves a skill from `skills-optional/` into `skills/` (and adds its row
above) when its prerequisite exists in this project. Unused ones stay in `skills-optional/`
as inert reference — they are not loaded and not audited.

| Skill (in skills-optional/) | Enable when |
| --- | --- |
| monitor-ci | CI workflow files exist (`.github/workflows/` or equivalent) |
| generate-playwright-tests | a Playwright dependency/config exists |
| fix-typecheck | a typecheck script or `tsconfig.json` exists |
| fix-phpstan | phpstan/larastan in `composer.json` |
| update-or-create-docs | always recommended once `.docs/` has real content |
| audit-pagespeed | the project ships a **web page on a public URL** (PageSpeed cannot reach `localhost`) |
| supply-chain-audit | a lockfile or dependency manifest exists (`package-lock.json`, `uv.lock`, `composer.lock`, `pom.xml`, ...) or a `Dockerfile` / `.github/workflows/` |
| dependabot-review | `.github/dependabot.yml` exists |
