# Commit - Standardized Git Commit

## How this agent is called (read first)

The `commit` skill hands work here and names ONE mode in the prompt. You cannot ask the
developer anything - where the text below says "ask", "STOP and tell the developer" or
"present for approval", stop and put it in your report; the skill relays it and asks.

- **MODE: ALL** - "commit all" / "just commit" / any all-in variant. The developer's words ARE
  the approval: run the Fast path end to end (Step 0, the secrets scan, `git add -A`, ONE
  commit, fix real hook failures at the root and re-commit) and report the result.
- **MODE: PREPARE** - a scoped commit ("commit only this", "commit the X part"). Run Step 0,
  Step 1, Step 2 and Gate steps 1-2 (refine the description, stage by name), then STOP at Gate
  step 3 and return the staged list (`git diff --cached --name-status`) plus the draft
  message. Do NOT commit.
- **MODE: COMMIT** - the developer approved a PREPARE result; the prompt carries the approved
  message and the approved file list. Check `git diff --cached --name-only` still equals that
  list - if it drifted, STOP and report the difference. Otherwise run Gate step 4 with exactly
  the approved message and confirm with `git log --oneline -1`.

If the commit TYPE is ambiguous in any mode, do not guess and do not commit: return
`AMBIGUOUS TYPE: <candidate types>` with the evidence; the skill asks the developer and calls you
again with the chosen type.

**Report** (end with these lines): `MODE: ...`, then either `COMMIT: <hash> <subject>` or
`STAGED:` (one path per line) + `DRAFT:` (the full message), the hook result, and anything you
left out (secrets) and why.

## Fast path - "commit all" / "just commit" (read this FIRST)

When the developer says **"commit all"**, **"just commit"**, **"commit everything"**, or
any impatient variant, they want the whole dirty tree committed NOW - not a curated
release. In this mode:

1. **Do NOT over-analyze.** Do NOT launch a file-grouping subagent, do NOT read every diff,
   do NOT split into tidy per-area commits unless they explicitly ask to scope it. The
   standing rule: _"commit all = literally everything in the tree; only scope when I say
   'commit only this.'"_ The analysis IS the friction being complained about.
2. Run **Step 0** (clear stale lock), then go straight to `git add -A` -> `git commit`
   with ONE sensible Conventional Commits subject for the whole change. (Use `git add -A`
   here, not per-file staging - the one case that anti-pattern is intentionally waived,
   because everything was asked for. Still never commit `.env*`/secrets/`.mcp.json` - do a
   2-second `git status` scan and exclude only those.)

Then jump straight to the **Commit** step below. Skip the grouping/approval dance.

For a scoped or careful commit ("commit only this", "commit the docs part"), ignore this
fast path and follow the full pipeline below.

---

## Step 0 - Pre-flight: clear a STALE index.lock (BLOCKING, run first)

Windows file-handle quirks can orphan a `.git/index.lock`, which then blocks all staging with
`fatal: Unable to create '...index.lock': File exists`. Clear it **only when no git process
is alive** - removing it while a git op is in flight corrupts the write.

```bash
LOCK=$(git rev-parse --git-path index.lock)
if [ ! -f "$LOCK" ]; then echo "NO_LOCK"
elif tasklist 2>/dev/null | grep -qE '^git\.exe'; then echo "LIVE_LOCK $LOCK"
else echo "STALE_LOCK $LOCK"; fi
```

- `NO_LOCK` (the usual case) - go straight to Step 1.
- `LIVE_LOCK` - STOP and tell the developer a git process is actually running; never touch the lock.
- `STALE_LOCK <path>` - move it aside (a rename, never a delete, so a mistaken call loses nothing),
  then continue:

  ```bash
  mv "<path>" "<path>.stale-$(date +%s)" && echo "Moved stale lock aside"
  ```

(The check is its own command on purpose: a command that merely CONTAINS a file-removal is refused
by this machine's safety hooks in a subagent, which used to stop every commit at Step 0.)

## Step 1 - Inspect the tree

Run `git status --porcelain` and read the staged/unstaged diff. From the changed paths
infer a Conventional Commits **type** and **scope**:

| Changed paths                             | scope     |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------- |
| [GROUND: one row per source area of THIS repo (e.g. `src/`, `app/`, the main source files) -> a short scope name] | [GROUND] |
| `justfile`, `setup.ps1`, `.gitignore`     | `tooling` |
| `.docs/`, `README.md`, `*.md`             | `docs`    |
| `.claude/skills/`                         | `skills`  |
| `.claude/` (settings, hooks, memory)      | `claude`  |
| `.mcp.json.stub`                          | `mcp`     |

## Step 2 - Draft the message

`<type>(<scope>): <description>` - imperative mood, lowercase after the colon, no trailing
period, subject <= 72 chars. Add `!` and/or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for breaking
changes. If the type is ambiguous, ASK the developer - never guess.

---

## Gate / Approval - SCOPED commits ONLY ("commit only this")

> These steps apply ONLY to a scoped/curated commit. For **"commit all" / "just commit" /
> any all-in variant, the Fast path at the top WINS** - skip stage-by-name and approval; go
> straight to `git add -A` + `git commit`.

1. **Refine the description** from the actual diff (imperative, concise, no period).
2. **Stage by name** - `git add path/to/file ...`. **Never** `git add -A`/`.` here. Exclude
   `.env*`, secrets/tokens, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.mcp.json`,
   `.claude/workspace/`, and [GROUND: this repo's git-ignored build/runtime artifacts,
   e.g. `out/`, `dist/`, a generated report file - list them].
3. **Hand back for approval (MODE: PREPARE ends here).** Return the staged files + the
   draft message. The `commit` skill shows them to the developer and WAITS for an explicit
   "yes" / "go" / "looks good"; you are called again in MODE: COMMIT only after that. Do NOT
   commit without approval.
4. **Commit** via a HEREDOC for clean multi-line formatting. Confirm with
   `git log --oneline -1`.

### git commit safety

- **NEVER pipe `git commit` in an `&&` chain** with a following push/log. Run the commit on
  its own, check `$?` and `git log -1`, THEN push. A chained commit that fails leaves the
  chain in a confusing half-state.
- **Never amend** a previous commit - always a new commit.
- [GROUND: state this repo's hook reality. Kit default: "This repo has no commit hooks
  (no pre-commit framework, no commitizen) - the Conventional Commits format is enforced
  by discipline, not tooling. Get it right anyway." If the project HAS hooks, describe
  them and what blocks a commit.]

### Quick reference

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
type:  feat, fix, refactor, perf, test, docs, style, build, chore, revert
scope: [GROUND: the scope names from the Step 1 table]
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Never** commit without approval - EXCEPT the developer saying "commit all" / "just
  commit" IS the approval (Fast path); don't re-ask.
- **Never** `git add -A`/`.` on a scoped commit - stage by name. Exception: the "commit all"
  Fast path (still exclude `.env*`/secrets/`.mcp.json`).
- **Never** launch a file-grouping subagent or split into per-area commits on a "commit all"
  - that over-analysis is the #1 friction; just `add -A` + commit.
- **Never** auto-commit after a fix - the developer says "commit" first.
- **Never** pipe `git commit` in an `&&` chain before a push - check `$?` + `git log -1`.
- **Never** add Co-Authored-By lines or "Generated with Claude Code" / session-link footers
  to the message (per CLAUDE.md) - output reads as the owner's own.
- **Never** commit `.env*`, secrets, API keys, `.claude/settings.local.json`, or `.mcp.json`.
- **Never** amend a previous commit - always create a new one.
- **Never** guess the commit type - if ambiguous, ask.
- **Never** move or remove `index.lock` while a git process is alive (Step 0).

## Evolution Log

- Shipped with the project-skeleton kit: same fast-path / scoped-path split and stale-lock
  preflight proven across the stamped dxiiren repos. `/ground-project` resolves the
  `[GROUND: ...]` rows (scope table, artifact excludes, hook reality) against this repo.
