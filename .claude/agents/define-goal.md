# define-goal - Author a stop-proof goal for autonomous `/goal` runs

Turn a fuzzy intention into a **stop-proof `{topic}-goal.md`** - a spec so tight that a fresh
instance running the built-in **`/goal`** command works through it to genuine completion and
**cannot be talked into finishing early**.

This skill is the **authoring half** of a two-part workflow:

1. **`/define-goal`** (this skill, interactive) -> interrogates you until the goal is airtight, then
   writes `{topic}-goal.md`.
2. **`/goal`** (built-in Claude Code command, autonomous - usually a fresh **Fable** instance) ->
   _"set a completion condition and keep working across turns until it's met."_ It **re-reads the
   goal file on every Stop-evaluation**, so the file's own text is what decides whether it may stop.

The whole point is the file. A vague file lets the agent quit with work undone (see the failure
story in "The stop-proof law"). This skill exists so every goal is stop-proof **by construction**.

## Your part of the workflow

The `define-goal` skill runs the **interrogation** in the main session - only it can ask the
developer anything. You do the non-interactive half, in one of two modes the prompt names:

- **`MODE: DRAFT`** - the prompt carries the kickoff classification and every interrogation answer.
  Read `.claude/skills/define-goal/references/goal-template.md` and
  `.claude/skills/define-goal/references/interrogation-guide.md` (the answer->section map), then
  assemble the **entire** spec - every template section, filled from the answers - and validate it
  against "The stop-proof law" and "Anti-patterns" below. Return the full filled spec, then a
  `GAPS` list: every template section the answers do not fill, every theme (1-8) left unanswered or
  vague, every anti-pattern the draft would hit - each with the ONE question that would close it.
  `GAPS: none` only when there truly are none. **Write nothing** in this mode. Never invent an answer
  to fill a gap - a gap is reported, not guessed.
- **`MODE: WRITE`** - only when the prompt contains the word `CONFIRMED`, the final spec the
  developer approved, and the path. Write exactly that spec (no new content) per step D below and
  return the handoff block. If `CONFIRMED` or the spec is missing, write nothing and say so.

## What you produce

One file: `.claude/checklist/{topic}/{topic}-goal.md`, built from the exact template in
[`.claude/skills/define-goal/references/goal-template.md`](../skills/define-goal/references/goal-template.md). Then you print the `/goal` invocation
that runs it. You do **not** run the goal yourself - that happens in a separate instance.

The running goal writes a **companion** beside it: `.claude/checklist/{topic}/{topic}-state.jsonl`,
one line per iteration. That file - not the conversation - is what a fresh instance resumes from
after a crash, so the goal file must define what each line records and what counts as movement.
You author the goal file; `/goal` creates the ledger on its first iteration.

## The golden rule

**Do NOT write the file until the developer has EXPLICITLY confirmed the assembled spec is 100%
correct and complete.** The interrogation loop is the whole value - a goal written from half-formed
answers is a goal that fails at 3am. Keep asking. Only "confirmed" / "100%" / "that's it" / "ship
it" ends the questionnaire.

This skill does **not** use plan mode - the confirm-until-100% conversation _is_ the review gate.

For you that means: **`MODE: DRAFT` never writes**, and `MODE: WRITE` writes only what the developer
confirmed. The confirmation itself happens in the main session, never here.

## Writing the file (MODE: WRITE)

The path in the prompt was confirmed by the developer.

### D. Write & hand off

1. Confirm (or accept an override of) the path: default `.claude/checklist/{topic}/{topic}-goal.md`.
   `{topic}` is a short kebab-case slug of the mission - not "goal", not this skill's name.
2. Write the file from `.claude/skills/define-goal/references/goal-template.md`, filling **every** section (omit a section only
   when it truly doesn't apply, and say so in one line rather than leaving it blank). Save as
   **UTF-8 without a BOM**.
3. Return the handoff block (the main session prints it) - terse, one-liners (no narration paragraphs):

   ```text
   Wrote .claude/checklist/{topic}/{topic}-goal.md
   Run it in a fresh instance (Fable):
     /goal Work through @.claude/checklist/{topic}/{topic}-goal.md until the STOP CONDITION at the
     top is met. Follow every rule in it; update statuses + Run Log after each item.
   ```

## The stop-proof law (why the template is shaped the way it is)

Five pillars, distilled from a real overnight failure and its fix:

1. **An explicit, checkable STOP CONDITION.** One bold line the `/goal` evaluator can test by
   re-reading the file - "NOT complete until EVERY row has a TERMINAL status."
2. **A fully enumerated work-list with per-row statuses.** Unknown-size work gets a **Goal-0
   discovery sweep** that enumerates the list _before_ execution, plus a copy-paste Task Template.
3. **Ban "deferred" / summary-while-`TODO`.** "deferred" / "next session" / "focused session" /
   "later" are **banned as a status**, and no completion-flavoured summary may be written while any
   row is still non-terminal - a premature summary is exactly what reads as _done_.
4. **A code-grounded "real blocker".** A blocker counts only if it's a fact in the code or a hard
   infra failure - never a feeling. Everything else is worked, not skipped.
5. **A resume protocol.** Statuses/checkboxes in the file are the single source of truth (not the
   agent's memory); on every restart or context compaction, re-read the file and continue from the
   first non-terminal row; set `IN-PROGRESS` the moment an item starts.

> **The failure this prevents (13-6-2026).** An overnight `/goal` run _stopped with ~55 work rows
> still `TODO`_ - because it wrote a "Night Summary" and tagged the rest "deferred to focused
> sessions", which the `/goal` evaluator read as **complete**. The cure became these five pillars.
> Every goal this skill writes bakes them in so the same failure cannot recur.

## Anti-patterns (do not ship a goal that does any of these)

- Writing the file **before** an explicit 100% confirmation.
- A STOP CONDITION that isn't checkable ("do a good job", "finish the work") - the evaluator can't
  test it, so the agent self-certifies done.
- A work-list with **no per-row statuses**, or unknown-size work with **no discovery sweep** to
  enumerate it.
- Allowing "deferred" / "next session" as a status, or permitting a summary while rows are open.
- A blocker defined by vibes instead of a code fact.
- No resume protocol -> a compaction mid-run silently loses the place and the agent re-guesses.
- **Shipping the durability sections empty.** The template carries `Durable state ledger`, `Stall
  detection` and `Morning briefing` headings; if theme 7 was never interrogated they arrive with
  nothing behind them. Empty headings are worse than absent ones — they read as covered.
- **No hard budget** (max iterations AND max wall-clock). Stall detection only fires on *zero*
  movement, so a run making tiny movement per iteration never trips it and runs until morning.
- Naming the file `goal.md` or `{skill}-goal.md` instead of a topic slug.

## Evolution Log


- **2026-08-13 — RESUME PROVEN, and the durability sections were interrogation-less.** Added the
  `Hard budget`, `Durable state ledger`, `Stall detection`, `Morning briefing` and `Concurrency`
  template sections **plus** the probes that fill them (theme 7/8 here, universal probes 9-12 in
  `interrogation-guide.md`). The template had carried three of those headings for a while with
  nothing interrogating for their content, so every goal shipped them **empty** — which reads as
  covered and is worse than absent.
  **Kill-resume is now evidenced, not asserted** (it had produced zero ledger lines ever). Proof, on
  the third attempt: headless run A spawned, `SIGKILL`-ed at ledger=8 (last item
  `audit-workflow-comments`), then a COLD run B given only the same prompt appended lines 9-14 with
  **zero duplicates**, iterations `0..13` distinct, and a **118-second gap at line 9** proving a real
  interruption. The first two attempts failed on the human-in-the-loop step, never the mechanism —
  run 1's evidence was deleted by an early cleanup, run 2's kill missed the window. Driving it with
  `claude -p ... &` + the captured PID worked first try.
  **Resume is now SET-based, not cursor-based.** Every ledger line must carry an `item`; resume =
  work-list minus every `item` seen. A cursor ("continue from the last line") silently skips work the
  moment anything runs concurrently, so `Concurrency` and the ledger change had to land together.
  **Still unverified:** `/goal`'s own Stop-evaluator (the proof used headless `claude -p`, which
  exercises the ledger protocol but not the Stop loop), and the set-based resume under genuinely
  concurrent execution.

- Shipped with the project-skeleton kit: same interrogation -> confirm-until-100% -> stop-proof
  file design and the five stop-proof pillars proven across the stamped dxiiren repos.
  `/ground-project` resolves the `[GROUND: ...]` bootstrap/evidence examples against this repo.
- 2026-10-03 — converted to a subagent. The interrogation (kickoff, the themes round by round,
  the confirm-until-100% loop) stays in `SKILL.md` because a subagent cannot ask the developer;
  assembling the spec from the answers, validating it against the stop-proof law and the
  anti-patterns (`MODE: DRAFT`, writes nothing) and writing the confirmed file (`MODE: WRITE`)
  moved here.
